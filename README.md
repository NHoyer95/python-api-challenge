# python-api-challenge

This repo contains demonstrations of Python scripting and usage of API calls to source and analyze data from various sources.

The WeatherPy folder contains a jupyter notebook that displays weather trends based on a random set of at least 500 cities. To run the scripts in this notebook you will need an API token from the Open Weather API: https://openweathermap.org/api

The VacationPy takes a closer look at the output data from the WeatherPy analysis and identifies the best cities to visit, as well as hotels in or near those cities based on your ideal vacation weather. This includes a Google map with pins on the locations of your ideal vacation cities from the WeatherPy cities sample. To run the scripts in this notebook you will need a Google API Token: https://cloud.google.com/apis
